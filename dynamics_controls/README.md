|[Integral Sliding Mode Based Switched Structure Control Scheme for Robot Manipulators](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327807849_Integral_Sliding_Mode_Based_Switched_Structure_Control_Scheme_for_Robot_Manipulators)|[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/INtsyouET5Sxv6K6pIUcoQ?view)|Saad| This paper proposes the switching scheme between the inverse dynamics based centralized controller and a set of decentralized controllers. ISM is used as perturbation estimator and to provide robustness in front of a wide class of uncertainties |
|[Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance for Manipulators and Mobile Robots](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-8997-2_29)|[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/m_dwVyo9TnKIZQa5V7QGRQ?view)|Saad| This paper proposes the unique real time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots using Artifical Potential Field approach |
| [Customizable Three-Dimensional Printed Origami Soft Robotic Joint With Effective Behavior Shaping for Safe Interactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8481372/keywords#keywords)|[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@kZ5m8OgNSouLVUfdO4Vu3w/SJtDCMGtU)|Uddesh| A combination of passive stiffness presetting and active PID cascade control was implemented for a pneumatic soft origami rotary actuators (SoRAs).|
|[Hybrid neural network fraction integral terminal sliding mode control of an Inchworm robot manipulator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0888327016300449)|[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@kZ5m8OgNSouLVUfdO4Vu3w/B1Zd2z_58)|Uddesh| This paper proposes adaptive neural network method to estimate unknown disturbances. Chattering phenomena was reduced by the use of neural network |
