|[Integral Sliding Mode Based Switched Structure Control Scheme for Robot Manipulators](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327807849_Integral_Sliding_Mode_Based_Switched_Structure_Control_Scheme_for_Robot_Manipulators)|[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/INtsyouET5Sxv6K6pIUcoQ?view)|Saad| This paper proposes the switching scheme between the inverse dynamics based centralized controller and a set of decentralized controllers. ISM is used as perturbation estimator and to provide robustness in front of a wide class of uncertainties |
