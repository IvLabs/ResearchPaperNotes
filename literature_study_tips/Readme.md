# Reading Research Papers

These are the notes from the amazing lecture by Andrew Ng, full video can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI)

## Steps to follow

### Organizing the papers 

- Compile a list of resources
    - Papers from arxiv and conferences
    - Journals
    - Medium/Github posts
    - Articles/Blogs
- Skim through the list of resources
    - Make a table, where rows represent lists of papers and a column for a metric of how much you understood through skimming (10-100%)
    	- Now read the one with the lowest value of the metric, try to understand the paper, if you can't, go to the references, and read those till you get a basic idea of the paper.
	- Keep doing this till you have a basic knowledge of the papers
    - Then Select the papers you feel is worthy enough to be completely read.
    - Reading around 5-20 papers, you'll have some basic idea of the field and for implementing the works
    - Reading around 50-100 papers, you'll have a deep understanding to do in-depth research (it does not mean you have mastered the field :smile:)

### Guide for a single paper 

Take multiple passes through the papers
- First Pass
    - Read Titles, Abstract, and Figures (only figures can sometimes summarize the entire paper)
- Second Pass
    - Read more carefully the Introduction, Conclusion, Figures and then skim through the rest (skip related work if you're not familiar with it in the second pass)
- Third Pass
    - Read but skip or skim the Math
- Fourth Pass
    - Whole thing but skip parts that don't make sense

### Questions to keep in mind

Ask yourself these questions while reading the paper
- What are the authors trying to accomplish in this work? 
- What were the key elements of the approach in this work?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do you want to follow?

## Some Sources of Papers

* Top Tier Conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICRA, RSS, IROS (more on this [here](https://github.com/IvLabs/resources/tree/master/conferences))
* Twitter
* Subreddits
* Paper Reading Groups, Communities and Friends

## General Tips

### Math

To understand the Maths behind the paper
- Read a few passes and make detailed notes
- Try to rederive the math from scratch on blank paper, 
    - If you can do this, then you can learn to derive your own novel algorithms
    	- Eg. People from the art community sit in the art museum and they copy the work of the masters

### Code

- Download and run the open-source code,
- And try to reimplement it from scratch

## Long term advice

* Keep reading papers consistently
	* In doing so you won't gain expertise in one day, you won't get a lot of knowledge from reading one paper a weekend. But if you keep doing this for a year, you'll reach somewhere
* One great project is better than many lame projects
* Focus on the team (people you interact with)
* Maintain a work-life balance
