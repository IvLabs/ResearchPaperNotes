| Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces | [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@FtbpSED3RQWclbmbmkChEA/rkTjKdRMS) | [Sharath](https://sharathraparthy.github.io/) | These notes review some of the fundamental concepts of linear algebra like vector spaces, inner product spaces, etc., and then introduces the basic concepts of RKHS. |
| Guaranteed computation of robot trajectories | [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@kZ5m8OgNSouLVUfdO4Vu3w/r1CrveDuI/edit) | Uddesh Tople |A contractor-based approach is proposed for guaranteed integration of state equations. The framework is based on the use of tubes as envelopes of feasible trajectories. |
